# A-PREDICTIVE-MAINTENANCE-FRAMEWORKS-UNSUPERVISED-STAGING-OF-METAL-OXIDATION-IN-MICRO-IMAGING

This work presents an automated approach for analyzing under-deposit corrosion (UDC) using machine learning and image processing techniques. The provided MATLAB (.m) file executes the proposed algorithm to characterize local porosity and deposit thickness from optical microscopy (OM) images of boiler tube deposits.
